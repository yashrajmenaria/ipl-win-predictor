#  IPL Win Predictor

##  Overview
The **IPL Win Predictor** is a machine learning-based application that predicts the win probability for both teams during an IPL match.  
By analyzing real-time match conditions such as **overs remaining, wickets fallen, runs scored, and target**, the model provides a probability-based insight into which team is more likely to win.

## Model Development

The dataset includes IPL match statistics and outcomes.

Data preprocessing and feature engineering were performed using Pandas and NumPy.

The predictive model was trained and tested using Scikit-learn with performance metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC considered.

The final model was integrated into a Streamlit web app for user-friendly access.
